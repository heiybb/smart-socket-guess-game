### Build & Run
#### Server  
``javac -cp .:lib/* *.java``  
``java -cp .:lib/* Server``  

#### Client     
``javac -cp .:lib/* *.java``  
``java -cp .:lib/* Client <host> <port> <autoReg> <autoGuess>`` 

#### Options  
``java -cp .;lib\* Client 127.0.0.1 51900 t t``  
Connect to 127.0.0.1:51900 with auto register auto guess both enable

``java -cp .;lib\* Client 127.0.0.1 51900 f f``  
Connect to 127.0.0.1:51900 with auto register auto guess both disable

**Tips**: Replace ``:`` with ``;`` and ``/`` with ``\`` in windows  

### Check port
Run ``netstat -an|grep tcp|grep :`` replace ``:`` with ``port`` to check if the port is occupied or not  

### Game Rules
- Server will generate a number range of 0-9 every round.
- Server limit 3 registered players to play at the same time.
- Player has 4 chances to guess, clue will be given if guess the wrong answer.
- Each round has a 35 seconds time limit.
- Client has a 30 seconds AFK time limit while not in the pending status.
- If the round reachs the limit or all players finish the guess(get the correct answer or use out of the tries), the server will broadcast the rank info to every player(players who didn't get the correct answer will not be in the rank).
- After rank output, players will be asked to choose to play again or quit the game.
